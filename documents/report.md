# Report for the group assignment: 

In this report, we will document our process for this CSS Advanced oblig.


### How we did the task:

#### 1. Identifying the main components
We started by observing both the webpages (scrennshots) and identifying the main components. We marked these components.

Here is our images from this part of the task:

#### 2. Implement BEM code for the components
Then we gave BEM names to the components we had identified.

Screenshot 1:
- nav bar ---> .header_nav-list
- input text ---> .search__input
- button --> .categories__item
- card --> .card

Screenshot 2:
- card --> .login
- input text --> .login__form-input (type="text" id="username")
- input password --> .login__form-input (type="password" id="password")
- button --> .login__button

Add image from demo.html
Add image from page-screenshot1.html
Add image from page-screenshot2.html
   

### Conclusion

Through this assignment, we have learned more about the use of BEM. 
We have understood more on how to work togehter in a Github reposistory, and finalize a comined "product" working this way
